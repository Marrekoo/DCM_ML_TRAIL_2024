# Understanding the Decision-Making Process in Choice Modelling through Serious Game

Gabriel Nova, Sander van Cranenburgh and Stephane Hess

The choice modelling research is developed for estimating, analysing, and predicting human choice behaviour. This research process is often complex and time-consuming, involving several interdependent research phases and methodological decisions that can lead different model outcomes. However, there is a lack of understanding on the decision-making research process in choice modelling, as well as limited knowledge about how the workflows performed by choice modeller led to different results, interpretations, and conclusions even from the same database. That is, how the cumulative impact of earlier decisions throughout the modelling process shapes the outcomes of final models. 

In this study, we aim to shed light on the choice modelling research process by employing serious game methodology, empirical data collection, and sequential pattern mining analysis. So, this approach involves developing a serious game that mimics the choice modelling process and collecting experimental data within a representative group of choice modelling researchers.

## Participate in the DCM Serious Game

We invite you to participate in our Serious Game on Discrete Choice Modeling (DCM). This educational experience is designed to enhance your understanding of decision modelling concepts. The game can be accessed [here](http://dcm-serious-game.tudelft.nl/).

## Your Feedback Matters

Your valuable [feedback](https://forms.gle/CubGJmiq13dwG7uc6) is essential to refining and improving the game for future users. We encourage you to express your thoughts openly, whether they are positive or suggest areas for enhancement.

Thank you for your participation in advancing our understanding of the decision-making process in choice modelling!
